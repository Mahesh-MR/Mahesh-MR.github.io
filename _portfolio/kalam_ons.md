Excerpts from the [Wings of Fire](https://ati.dae.gov.in/ati12052021_8.pdf), the autobiography of A P J Abdul kalam. 
> “Big scientific projects are like mountains, which
should be climbed with as little effort as possible and
without urgency. The reality of your own nature should
determine your speed. If you become restless, speed up. If
you become tense and highstrung, slow down. You should
climb the mountain in a state of equilibrium. When each
task of your project is not just a means to an end but a
unique event in itself, then you are doing it well,”

> To live only for some unknown future is superficial. It is
like climbing a mountain to reach the peak without
experiencing its sides. The sides of the mountain sustain
life, not the peak. This is where things grow, experience is
gained, and technologies are mastered. The importance of
the peak lies only in the fact that it defines the sides. So I
went on towards the top, but always experiencing the sides.
I had a long way to go but I was in no hurry. I went in little
steps—just one step after another—but each step towards
the top.


> I visualized my team as a group in which each member
worked to enrich the others in the team and experience the
enjoyment of working together.

> Many even called us a group of eccentric inventors in
pursuit of an impossible dream. I, being the leader of the
“navvies”, was a particularly inviting target. I was regarded
as yet another country bumpkin... The weight of opinion against us
buttressed my ever-optimistic mind. The comments of
some of the senior scientists  made me recall John
Trowbridge’s famous satirical poem on the Wright
Brothers, published in 1896:
<br> . . . . with thimble and thread
<br> 
And wax and hammer, and buckles and screws,
<br> 
And all such things as geniuses use; —
<br> 
Two bats for patterns, curious fellows!
<br> 
A charcoal-pot and a pair of bellows.



>There is always the danger that a person with my kind of
background— rural or small-town, middle-class, whose
parents had limited education— will retreat into a corner
and remain there struggling for bare existence, unless
some great turn of circumstance propels him into a more
favourable environment. I knew I had to create my own
opportunities.

> I often read Khalil Gibran, and always find his words full
of wisdom. “Bread baked without love is a bitter bread that
feeds but half a man’s hunger,”—those who cannot work
with their hearts achieve but a hollow, half-hearted success
that breeds bitterness all around. If you are a writer who
would secretly prefer to be a lawyer or a doctor, your written
words will feed but half the hunger of your readers; if you
are a teacher who would rather be a businessman, your
instructions will meet but half the need for knowledge of
your students; if you are a scientist who hates science, your
performance will satisfy but half the needs of your mission.


> Desire, when it stems from the heart and spirit, when it
is pure and intense, possesses awesome electromagnetic
energy. This energy is released into the ether each night,
as the mind falls into the sleep state. Each morning it
returns to the conscious state reinforced with the cosmic
currents. That which has been imaged will surely and
certainly be manifested. You can rely, young man, upon this
ageless promise as surely as you can rely upon the
eternally unbroken promise of sunrise... and of Spring



> To succeed in your mission, you must have single-minded devotion to your goal. Total commitment is a crucial quality for those who want
to reach the very top of their profession. The desire to work
at optimum capacity leaves hardly any room for anything
else.  he
difference between an energetic and a confused person is
the difference in the way their minds handle their
experiences. Man needs his difficulties because they are
necessary to enjoy success. All of us carry some sort of a
super-intelligence within us. Let it be stimulated to enable
us to examine our deepest thoughts, desires, and beliefs.

> Once you have done this—charged yourself, as it were,
with your commitment to your work—you also need good
health and boundless energy. Climbing to the top demands
strength, whether to the top of Mount Everest or to the top of
your career. People are born with different energy reserves
and the one who tires first and burns out easily will do well
to reorganize his or her life at the earliest.


> The pursuit of science is a combination of great elation
and great despair. I went over many such episodes in my
mind. Johannes Kepler, whose three orbital laws form the
basis of space research, took nearly 17 years after
formulating the two laws about planetary motion around the
sun, to enunciate his third law which gives the relation
between the size of the elliptical orbit and the length of time
it takes for the planet to go around the sun. How many
failures and frustrations must he have gone through? The
idea that man could land on the moon, developed by the
Russian mathematician Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, was
realised after nearly four decades—and by the United
States, at that. Prof. Chandrasekhar had to wait nearly 50
years before receiving the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the ‘Chandrasekhar Limit’, a discovery made while he was
a graduate student at Cambridge in the 1930s. If his work
had been recognized then, it could have led to the
discovery of the Black Hole decades earlier. How many
failures must von Braun have gone through before his
Saturn launch vehicle put man on the moon? These
thoughts helped to give me the ability to withstand
apparently irreversible setbacks.

 > By that evening, the news of India taking
up the indigenous development of a device to help short run
take-offs by high performance military aircraft, with myself
heading the project, was made public. I was filled with many
emotions— happiness, gratitude, a sense of fulfilment and
these lines from a littleknown poet of the nineteenth-century
crossed my mind:
<br> For all your days prepare
<br>
And meet them ever alike
<br>
When you are the anvil, bear –
<br>
When you are the hammer, strike.


In his words: If four things are followed - having a great aim, acquiring knowledge, hard work, and perseverance - then anything can be achieved!
