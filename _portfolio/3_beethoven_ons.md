Excerpts from a [letter](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Heiligenstadt_Testament) from Young Beethoven (age 32) to his brothers, in the backdrop of him as an aspiring musician, but losing his <q>hearing</q>, contemplating that "he is worthless". 
His Art kept him alive, and the rest we all know. 


>But, think that for six years now I have been hopelessly afflicted... I was soon compelled to withdraw myself, to live life alone... Oh I cannot do it; therefore forgive me when you see me draw back when I would have gladly mingled with you.

> But what a humiliation for me when someone standing next to me heard a flute in the distance and I heard nothing, or someone heard a shepherd singing and again I heard nothing, such incidents brought me to the verge of despair, but little more and I would have put an end to my life — only Art it was that withheld me, ah it seemed impossible to leave the world until I had produced all that I felt called upon me to produce, and so I endured this wretched existence — truly wretched, an excitable body which a sudden change can throw from the best into the worst state.  

> With joy I hasten to meed death. -- If it comes before I have had the chance to develop all my artistic capacities, it will still be coming too soon despite my harsh fate, and I should probably wish it later -- yet even so I should be happy, for would it not free me from a state of endless suffering? -- Come when thou wilt, I shall meed thee bravely. -- Farewell and do not wholly forget me when I am dead...   [&#91;Heiligenstadt Testament&#93;](https://www.beethoven.ws/heiligenstadt_testament.html)

Remember, he wrote this at his 32; then shall come like a beautiful hotspring seven symphonies and even at the age of [54](https://www.beethoven.ws/timeline.html), him being completely deaf, shall continue to sit in the Nature's lap for yet another of his masterpiece. For those who are disadvantaged, my friend, <q>This too shall pass and from the ashes we surely rise</q>.
