Excerpts from the [Biographical memories of John Bardeen](https://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/bardeen-john.pdf), which indicates Bardeen's beautiful  traits and his art of doing research. 


> None of us had worked on semiconductors during the war, so we were eager to learn about the developments that had taken place. With new
materials to study and new concepts to help understanding, it was a very exciting time to be involved in semiconductor research. We followed the
Bell Labs tradition of forming study groups to learn about what had been accomplished.

> The close collaboration between experimentalists and theorists extended through all stages of the research, from the conception of the experiment to the analysis of the results. Most papers were authored jointly by an experimentalist and a theorist. John was also a truly generous man.
He never hesitated to give others credit for their contributions to science.

> In addition to advising industry and government, Bardeen was generous with his time in giving talks to a remarkably broad spectrum of audiences eager to hear his views; these audiences ran the gamut from elementary-school children to meetings of medical societies. But throughout the two decades following BCS his central interest remained in physics, beginning with an authoritative review of BCS and its applications (written
with Bob Schrieffer in 1961), and including his study of the application of BCS theory to a number of superconducting phenomena.

> In working on these and other problems with students, postdocs, or colleagues, John did not take an Olympian stance. He was right there in the trenches, carrying out detailed calculations, checking factors, and being intimately involved in writing up the results for publication. Instead of basking in the glory brought his way by a continuing output of remarkable and seminal contributions, he preferred always to work on the next scientific challenge. There was almost no area of condensed-matter physics—from many-body theory to the motion of dislocations—about which he had not thought deeply, and because of his willingness to take on new challenges he was much sought after for advice and counsel when a new puzzle turned up in a paper or in the laboratory.

>  He especially admired the long-term view that leading Japanese corporations had adopted, as evidenced by their willingness to make substantive commitments to projects that might not pay off for a decade. He often contrasted that view with the much shorter attention
spans of their US counterparts.

> Bardeen’s scientific legacy is extraordinary for its breadth and depth. But in the long term its most important part may be his persona and scientific style, which so greatly influenced his students, postdocs, and colleagues and which can serve as beacons to future
generations of scientists.

> <h2>Ninefold way of John Bardeen's Art of Research</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Focus first on the experimental results through reading and personal contact.</li>
  <li>Develop a phenomenological description that ties different experimental results together.</li>
  <li>Explore alternative physical pictures and mathematical descriptions without
becoming wedded to any particular one.</li>
  <li>Macroscopic arguments have precedence over microscopic calculations.</li>
  <li>Focus on physical understanding, not mathematical elegance, and use the simplest
possible mathematical description of system behavior.</li>
  <li>Keep up with new theoretical techniques—for one of them may prove useful.</li>
  <li>Decide on a specific model as the penultimate, not the first, step toward a solution.</li>
  <li>Choose the right collaborators.</li>
  <li>DON’T GIVE UP: Stay with the problem until it is solved.</li>
</ol>
