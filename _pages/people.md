               I am actively looking for PhD and Masters (MS/MTP) students to work with me. <a href="../images/lincoln_v3_ons.jpg">Self motivated</a>, <a href="../images/kalam_ons.jpg">Ambitious</a> and <a href="../images/wright_brothers_quote.jpg">Keen</a> students with a research aptitude towards signal processing, image processing, computer vision, and applied mathematics are welcome to join our SPAI group. We closely follow this philosophy: please read <a href="../files/SPAI_philosophy_ons.pdf">this</a>.   If you are interested, please apply through the IIT Kharagpur PG admissions process, specifying <i>Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence</i> among your preferred departments/centres and listing me as a potential supervisor. 
              </p>   
              <p>
                Regarding internships, I see it as an integration of classroom knowledge and theory (studied in the first few years in UG) with practical application and skills (gained doing intership). For the same reason, sorry that I may not be able to entertain first/second year UG students.  
              </p>
              <p>
                The prospective students are encouraged to visit my group for two weeks to get a good understanding about my group, our working style, and to make an optimal decision based on bilateral matching. 
              </p>
              <p>
              LoR policy: Truth be told, my letter of recommendation does not have much value; so your depth and breadth of research should reflect your ambition!
