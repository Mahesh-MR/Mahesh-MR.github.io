We closely follow this philosophy: please read <a href="../files/SPAI_philosophy_ons.pdf">this</a>.   If you are interested, please apply through the IIT Kharagpur PG admissions process, specifying <i>Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence</i> among your preferred departments/centres and listing me as a potential supervisor. 
              </p>   
              <p>
                The prospective students are encouraged to visit my group for two weeks to get a good understanding about my group, our working style, and to make an optimal decision based on bilateral matching.
