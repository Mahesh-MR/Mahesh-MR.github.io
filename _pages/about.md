Welcome all! I am a final year Ph.D. scholar in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/), [I.I.T. Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), specializing in Signal Processing. I am advised by [Prof. A. N. Rajagopalan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~raju/), and I work in [Image Processing and Computer Vision Lab](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/). Here, my research lies at the intersection of Image Signal Processing, Computational Photography, and Computer Vision.

I am looking forward to expand my horizon to broader Computer Vision areas, with Signal Processing as its linchpin (for which I am eagerly looking for a Post-doc position).

Previously, I have completed Masters (M-Tech) in [Signal Processing](http://gectcr.ac.in/electronics-department/m-tech-ec/), advised by [Prof. Sheeba V. S.](http://gectcr.ac.in/about-us/principals-profile/), and Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering, both with honours.

I grew up in Kerala, India, a place adorned with [lush hues of Nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftrFhWrvcLo). 

For more details, please find my [CV](https://maheshmohanmr.github.io/cv/).
