I am a final year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/), [I.I.T. Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), specializing in Signal Processing. I am advised by [Prof. A. N. Rajagopalan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~raju/) and I work in [Image Processing and Computer Vision Lab](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/). Here, my research lies at the intersection of Signal Processing, Computer Vision, and Computational Photography. I am looking forward to expand my horizon to Deep Learning, with Signal Processing as its linchpin (for which I am eagerly looking for a Post-doc position).



.(Under Construction)
- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
