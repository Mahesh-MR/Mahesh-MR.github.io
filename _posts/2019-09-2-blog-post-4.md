&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  During my "first" friendly, yet long fight with this website scripts, I often asked myself: "Why endure this long fight?". Every time, I shyly answered: <q>To make someone's long fight short</q>. For not fooling myself, or in the immortal words of [Ricahrd Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) <q><i>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.</i></q>, a blog is born – to help you with your website. For those who are going ahead, wish you a <q>Happy Website building</q>! 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is optimized for Research Scholars, who have nice representative images for their publications (Computer Vision, here I come!), who can contribute materials for teaching, talks, etc. (Educators, find this!) and write occasional blog posts (ahem). As I started building this website with zero knowledge of HTML scripts, and ended up with close to zero knowledge,  sadly, I cannot ask for any pre-requisite (so for the html pros out there, sorry if I sound childish!). Welcome all!   

Instructions to get your website
======
<br>1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!). Refer [this](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub). When you select an username, select something that matches with your domain name in mind, i.e., select <q>your GitHub username</q> for [your GitHub username].github.io. <br>
<br>2. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/maheshmohanmr/maheshmohanmr.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. (If you find it difficult to spot "fork" button, see Fig. 1 below.<br> 
<br>3. Go to the repository's settings (see Fig. 1). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL. <br>

<br> <b>Congratulations, now you have a website on your own <q>but with my data</q>!</b> 

Where to tweek for what?
-----
(Note: Always, I mean the root directory (./) as the outer one, i.e., where you can see the folders: \_data, \_drafts, etc, the one showed in Fig. 1 )
<br>1. First, edit the ./\_config.yml with your details, e.g., avatar for profile picture, url and reposiory as your corresponding links, etc.<br>
<br>2. Coming to my tabs, i.e., Research Talks Teaching etc, if you want to have something different like Publications Projects Talks etc, change the ./\_data/navigation.yml for tabnames as well as Headers.<br>
