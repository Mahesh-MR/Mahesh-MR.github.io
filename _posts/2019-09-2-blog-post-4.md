&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  During my "first" friendly, yet long fight with this website scripts, I often asked myself: "Why endure this long fight?". Every time, I shyly answered: <q>To make someone's long fight short</q>. For not fooling myself, or in the immortal words of [Ricahrd Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) <q><i>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.</i></q>, a blog is born – to help you with your website. For those who are going ahead, wish you a <q>Happy Website building</q>! 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is optimized for Research Scholars, who have nice representative images for their publications (Computer Vision, here I come!), who can contribute materials for teaching, talks, etc. (Educators, find this!) and write occasional blog posts (ahem). As I started building this website with zero knowledge of HTML scripts, and ended up with close to zero knowledge,  sadly, I cannot ask for any pre-requisite (so for the html pros out there, sorry if I sound childish!). Welcome all!   

Instructions to get your website
======
<br>1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!). Refer [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub). When you choose an username, select your desired domain name in mind, i.e., select <q>your GitHub username</q> for [your GitHub username].github.io. <br>
<br>2. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/maheshmohanmr/maheshmohanmr.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. (spot "fork" button in Fig. 1).<br> 
<br>3. Go to the repository's settings (see Fig. 1). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL. <br>

<br> <b>Congratulations, now you have a website on your own</b>, <q>but with my data</q>! 

Where to tweek for what?
-----
(Note: Always, I mean the root directory (./) as the outer one, i.e., the one showed in Fig. 1 where you can see the folders: \_data, \_drafts, etc. <br>
<br>1. First, edit the ./\_config.yml with your details, e.g., avatar for your profile picture; url and repository as your corresponding links; timezone; etc.<br>
<br>2. Coming to the tabs and corresponding, i.e., Research Talks Teaching etc, if you want to have something different like Publications Projects Talks etc, change appropriately the ./\_data/navigation.yml.<br>
<br>3. Information of your home page can be set from ./\_pages/\_about.md.<br>
<br>4. The footnotes for each tab can be edited from  ./\_pages/<q>corresponding</q> .md files.<br>
<br>5. To change the publications, edit ./\_publications.md. Note well that the image tag for each publications (have eight occurences) need to be different for proper animations, e.g. the first paper here has <q>font\_</q> as its tag.<br>
<br>6. Contents for the tabs:Talks, Teaching, Blog posts, Quotes; can be changes using the files within the corresponding folder, i.e., ./\_talks, ./\_teaching, etc.<br>
<br>7. CV can be set from ./\_pages/\_cv.md.<br>
<br>8. There is no restriction to put files in a folder (e.g., pdfs, images we put in ./\_files, ./\_images, etc). To put, click upload button (right-top) and upload. 
<br>9. However, images for blogposts need to be in ./asset folder for working (don't know why). <br>
<br>7. Editing a file, I mean, click the respective file, click the pencil button (right-top), edit and click commit changes at the bottom. (After commiting, the updates to your website will be only done within few minutes.).<br>
(For quick reference of <q>where to tweek for what</q>, refer Fig. 2.)<br>



 <br><b>Now you have your own webpage. May your research and contents soar to great heights.</b>.    (I would like to know whether my effort helped anyone. If you have few seconds, send an email with the link of your created webpage; let our hearts smile. Thank you!)
