&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  During my "first" friendly, yet long fight with this website scripts, I often asked myself: "Why endure this long fight?". Every time, I shyly answered: <q>To make someone's long fight short</q>. For not fooling myself, or in the immortal words of [Ricahrd Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) <q><i>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.</i></q>, a blog is born – to help you with your website. For those who are going ahead, wish you a <q>Happy Website building</q>! 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is optimized for Research Scholars, who have nice representative images for their publications (Computer Vision, here I come!), who can contribute materials for teaching, talks, etc. (Educators, find this!) and write occasional blog posts (ahem). As I started building this website with zero knowledge of HTML scripts, and ended up with close to zero knowledge,  sadly, I cannot ask for any pre-requisite (so for the html pros out there, sorry if I sound childish!). Welcome all!   

Instructions to get your website
======
<br>1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!). Refer [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub). When you choose an username, select your desired domain name in mind, i.e., select <q>your GitHub username</q> for [your GitHub username].github.io. <br>
<br>2. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/maheshmohanmr/maheshmohanmr.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. (spot "fork" button in Fig. 1).<br> 
<br>3. Go to the repository's settings (see Fig. 1). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL. <br>

<br> <b>Congratulations, now you have a website on your own</b>, <q>but with my data</q>!

Where to tweek for what?
-----
(Note: Always, I mean the root (./) as the outer one, i.e., the one in Fig. 1 where you can see the folders: \_data, \_drafts, etc. 
(For quick reference of <q>where to tweek</q>, refer Fig. 2.)<br>

<br><br>1. First, edit the ./\_config.yml with your details, e.g., avatar for your profile picture; url and repository as your corresponding links; timezone; etc.<br>
<br>2. Coming to the tabs and corresponding headers (i.e., Research Talks Teaching etc,), if you want to have something different (like Publications Projects Talks etc) change appropriately the ./\_data/navigation.yml.<br>
<br>3. Information of your home page can be set from ./\_pages/\_about.md.<br>
<br>4. The footnotes for each tab can be edited from  ./\_pages/<q>corresponding</q> .md files.<br>
<br>5. To change the publications, edit ./\_publications.md. Note well that the image tag for each publications (that have eight occurences) need to be different for proper animations, e.g. the first paper here has <q>font\_</q> as its tag.<br>
<br>6. Contents for the tabs: Talks, Teaching, Blog posts, and Quotes; can be changed using the files within the corresponding folder, i.e., ./\_talks, ./\_teaching, etc.<br>
<br>7. CV can be set from ./\_pages/\_cv.md.<br>
<br>8. For publications, there is no restriction of which folder to put files (e.g., pdfs and images, we put in ./\_files, and ./\_images, respectively)  and invoke. To put, click upload button (right-top) and upload the files. <br>
<br>9. However, images for blogposts need to be in ./asset folder for working (don't know why). <br>
<br>10. Editing a file, I mean, click the respective file, click the pencil button (right-top), edit and click commit changes at the bottom. (After commiting, the updates to your website will be only done within few minutes.).

  It's now your own webpage! (I would like to know whether my effort helped anyone. If you have few seconds, send an email with the link of your webpage; let our hearts smile. Thank you!). <br><center><b> May your research, teaching and materials soar to great heights.</b> </center>
