 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember a time you enjoyed rain â€“  it merrily coming from a distant, bringing the smell of sand; trees dancing to its beat, kids escaping from their mother's clutch;  the bonding we feel with nature. I sometimes ask myself: <q>When did we miss this?</q> Today, in the backdrop of floods, land-slides, and other disasters, when rain comes, all I see is fear looming in each and every eyes; wondering of floods, abandoned homes, dear ones lost, .... <q>Where did we went wrong? Do we want to instill the same fear for the generations to come?</q> So, this is my brick! Welcome all.    

Rain.

Wolf and her.
-----
Stoic was she, with a gentle smile,<br>
faced the storm, without complaint;<br>
As enemies they met and stayed,<br>
 but with hearts for no hate. <br><br>


 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing he, the Wolf, may kill her smile,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the Nature then shall lose her grace,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as enough is enough for the pain she had;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; though parting for him is hard to bear.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet he ran in the woods, deeper and deeper,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; still with a heart for no hate, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and deeper and deeper, to save her smile!<br>
