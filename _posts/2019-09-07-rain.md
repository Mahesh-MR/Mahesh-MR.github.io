 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember a time you enjoyed rain â€“  it merrily coming from a distance, bringing the smell of sand; trees dancing to its beat, kids escaping from their mother's clutch;  the bonding we feel with nature. I sometimes ask myself: <q>When did we miss this</q>. Today, in the backdrop of floods, land-slides, and other disasters, when rain comes I only see fear looming in every eyes; asking themselves, will flood hit, lose dear ones, etc. <q>Where did we went wrong? Do we want to instill the same fear for the generations to come?</q> So, this is my brick! Welcome all.    

Let the rain soothes you.
