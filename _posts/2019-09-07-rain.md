 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember a time you enjoyed rain â€“  it merrily coming from a distant, bringing the smell of sand; trees dancing to its beat, kids escaping from their mother's clutch;  the bonding we feel with nature. I sometimes ask myself: <q>When did we miss this?</q> Today, in the backdrop of floods, land-slides, and other disasters, when rain comes, all I see is fear looming in each and every eyes; wondering of floods, abandoned homes, dear ones lost, .... <q>Where did we went wrong? Do we want to instill the same fear for the generations to come?</q> So, this is my brick! Welcome all.    

Rain.

The Wolf and Her.
-----
Stoic was she, with a gentle smile,<br>
faced the storm, without complaint;<br>
As enemies they met and stayed,<br>
 but with two hearts for no hate. <br><br>


 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing he, the Wolf, may kill her smile,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Nature then shall lose her grace,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for enough is enough for the pain she had;<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but parting for him is too hard to bear.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet he ran in the woods, deeper and deeper,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; still with a heart for no hate, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and deeper and deeper, to save her smile!<br>

My Little Girl Forever.
-----
I know that you miss me dearly, <br>
and will hold that little pique, <br>
for at odds with your prayers, <br>
I had to leave you early. <br><br>


 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But know this for sure, when <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my angel called from heaven, <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told, I will miss my little girl, <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and want her smile forever. <br><br>


&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So promised me a tiny window, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to send my blessings and wish <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for a great life, despite all odds, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to see my girl regaining her joy, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and rejoice in her smile, all day. <br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I'm proud of your smile, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with that my heart smile; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want that forever;   <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Little Girl Forever . . . <br>
