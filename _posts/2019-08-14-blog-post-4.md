This is the first blog post after I created this website. During my "first" friendly, yet long fight with website codes, I sometimes asked myself "Why endure this long fight?". Every time, I shyly answered "to make someone's long fight short". To not fool myself, or in the immortal words of [Ricahrd Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) that <q>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself â€“ and you are the easiest person to fool.</q>, assisting you for a similar endeavour will make my task complete.
