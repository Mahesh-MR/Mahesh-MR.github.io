During my "first" friendly, yet long fight with this website scripts, I sometimes asked: "Why endure this long fight?". Every time, I shyly answered: "To make someone's long fight short". For not fooling myself, or in the immortal words of [Ricahrd Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) that <q>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.</q>, a blog is born – to help you with your website. For those who are going ahead, wish you <q>Happy website building</q>!
