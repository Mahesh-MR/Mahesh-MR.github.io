Welcome! During my "first" friendly, yet long fight with the scripts for this website, I often asked myself: "Why endure this long fight?". Every time, I shyly answered: <q>To make someone's long fight short</q>. For not fooling myself, or in the immortal words of [Ricahrd Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) <q><i>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.</i></q>, a blog is born – to help you with your website. For those who are going ahead, wish you a <q>Happy Website building</q>!  
 <br>
 This personal website is optimized for researchers, who can put nice representative images for their publications (Computer Vision, here I come!), who can contribute materials for teaching, talks, etc. (Educators, find this!) and write occasional blog posts (ahem). As I started building this website with zero knowledge of HTML and ended up with close to zero knowledge,  sadly, I cannot ask for any pre-requisite (so for the html pros out there, sorry if I sound childish).
