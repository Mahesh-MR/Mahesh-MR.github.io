   Here, I identified a problem statement, i.e., <q>Motion Deblurring for Dual-lens Camera </q>, and designed a research plan for the same. <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/sgirish">Sharath Girish</a> joined with me for implementation, which finally led to an ICCV-19 Oral paper.  Eventually, Sharath Girish got into Ph.D under <a href="http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~rama/">Prof. Rama Chellappa, University of Maryland, US</a>.
