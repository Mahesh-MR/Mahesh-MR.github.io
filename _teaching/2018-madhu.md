Lots of accidents are happening while exiting a vehicle from its side doors, for it is difficult to ensure whether another vehicle(s) are coming from behind and how fast it is. This project attempts to solve this issue. Project associate <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/madhumithra-krishnamoorthy-49981a153">Madumithra Krishnamoorthy</a> was incharge of this project. Together, we employ a side view camera and propose a deployable algorithm using traditonal image processing techniques to address this.
