Lots of accidents happen while exiting a vehicle from its side doors, for it is difficult to ensure whether another vehicle(s) are coming from behind and how fast it is. This project attempts to solve this issue; project associate <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/madhumithra-krishnamoorthy-49981a153">Madumithra Krishnamoorthy</a> was incharge. Together, we employ a side view camera and propose a deployable algorithm using image processing techniques to address this.
