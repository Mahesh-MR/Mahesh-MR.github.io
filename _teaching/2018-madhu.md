  Lots of accidents are happening while getting out of vehicle from its side doors, wherein it is difficult for one to ensure whether another vehicle(s) are coming from behind and how speed it has. This project attempts to solve this issue. Project associate <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/madhumithra-krishnamoorthy-49981a153">Madumithra Krishnamoorthy</a> was incharge of this project. Together, we employ a side view camera and propose a deployable algorithm using traditonal image processing techniques to address this.
