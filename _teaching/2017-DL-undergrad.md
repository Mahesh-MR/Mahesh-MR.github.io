   Here, I identified a problem statement, i.e., <q>Efficient Sketch Recognition for Resource-constrained platforms</q>, and designed a research plan for the same. Undergrads <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshitkumar">Akshit Kumar</a> and <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/sachin-agrawal-b33837b9">Sachin Agrawal</a> joined with me and finally got recognition for <i>the best Deep Learning course-project</i>. Presently, both the students are continuing research in Deep Learning, the former is a Master's student at the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan, US</a>, and the latter is a Data Scientist at  <a href="https://www.daimler.com/career/graduates/">Dailmer, Germany</a>.
