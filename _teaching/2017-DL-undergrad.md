   Here, I designed a plan and objective for the problem of <q>Efficient Sketch Recognition to run on Resource-constrained platforms, like Smartphones, Tablets, etc.</q>. Undergrads <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshitkumar">Akshit Kumar</a> and <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/sachin-agrawal-b33837b9">Sachin Agrawal</a> joined with me and finally got recognition for <i>the best project</i>. Presently, both the students are continuing research in Deep Learning, the former is a Masters' student at the University of Michigan, US, and the latter is a Data Scientist at Dailmer, Germany.
