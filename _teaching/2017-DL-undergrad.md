Here, we are asked to create a problem statement to attract two students, and mentor them to research on that topic towards the course project (40% of the total credit).  I designed a plan and objcetive for the problem of <q>Efficient Sketch Recognition to run on Resource-constrained platforms, like Smartphones, Tablets, etc.</q>. Undergrads [Akshit Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshitkumar) and [Sachin Agrawal](https://in.linkedin.com/in/sachin-agrawal-b33837b9) joined with me, and finally got recognition for <i>the best project<\i>. Currently, both the students are continuing research in Deep Learning, the former is a Masters' student at the [University of Michigan, US](https://umich.edu/), and the latter a Data Scientist in [Dailmer, Germany](https://www.daimler.com/career/graduates/).
