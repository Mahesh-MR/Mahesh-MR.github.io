  This Lecture Series started ata time when Deep Learning was taking off, and it aims to explain the (then) emerging field of deep learning
  for the (then) members of <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ipcvlab/">Image Processing and Computer Vision Lab</a> and  <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/comp_photolab/">Computational Imaging Lab</a>, headed by <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~raju/">Prof. A. N. Rajagopalan</a> and <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/kmitra/">Prof. Kaushik Mitra</a>, respectively. 
  
  <br> &nbsp Here the first lecture introduces Deep Learning (L1), followed later by a doubt-clearing session (L1.1). Lecture 2 attempts to cover Convolutional Neural Network (L2) and Lecture 3 provides a mathematical interpretation of Deep Learning. This series was concluded with Lecture 4, which attempts to explain several Deep Learning solutions for Image Processing (L4). Time for a secret: then I wandered over different domains but except Deep Learning, and now, when I look back the DL flight, O Lost!
