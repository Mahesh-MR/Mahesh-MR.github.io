A Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md. Then we have incorporated [Jona Barron's](https://github.com/jonbarron/website)
style for publication pages. Finally, made some beautification.
